magnets need to move into the 21st century. the NdFeB incumbent, which dominates over 60% of a $30B magnet market, was discovered in the 80s... surely we can do better.

project-14 aims to create novel generative and machine learning methods for discovering the next generation of magnetic materials.

curie temperature, thermodynamic stability, magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy, and total magnetic density are already being accurately predicted by project-14's models.

an adapted monte carlo tree search algorithm, a custom scoring function built from the project-14 property predictors, and an ensemble of inorganic crystal-specific generative models define a reinforcement learning environment that empowers the leading large language models to navigate the complex space of potential new magnets.

project-14 is actively searching for new candidates. over 2000 systems have been evaluated, and new soft magnets are everywhere. early findings suggest equiatomic FeCoNiPt has the potential to achieve competitive coercivity, [existing literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14506) shows that as cast, this alloy has a long way to go. with magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy north of 3 MJ/mÂ³, microstructure optimizations could bring this expensive challenger to performance parity.
