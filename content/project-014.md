magnets need to move into the 21st century. the NdFeB incumbent that dominates over 60% of a $30B magnet market was discovered in the 80's... surely we can do better.

project-14 aims to create novel generative and machine learning methods for discovering the next generation of magnetic materials.

curie temperature, thermodynamic stability, magneto crystalline anisotropy, and total mag density are already being accurately predicted by project-14's models.
